My name is wangtianyu and my English name is Tony. I am turning 17 and I am really looking forward to the new school year.I am extrovert and I enjoy sports. My favorite sport is basketball and Lebron James is my favorite player. I do lots of things for extracurricular activities and I gain lots of fun from listening to music, watching movies, to playing guitar and shooting films myself.
